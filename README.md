# rock-paper-scissors
This is a browser game of rock, paper, scissors built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Although it's admittedly quite simple, the game logic and event handling aspects of this project were an exciting challenge. I gained a much better understanding of how event handlers work and how to incorporate them to create an interactive page.
